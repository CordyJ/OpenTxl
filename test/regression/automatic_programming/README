TXL Example Specification
-------------------------

Name:	
	CGdb.Txl
	EPdb.Txl
	FHdb.Txl

Description:
	Early proof-of-concept prototypes for an automatic programming 
	system designed to support automatic instantiation of C coding
	templates from Prolog-style design factbases.  The project later
	went on to use TXL to implement a general purpose multi-linguistic 
	metaprogramming system, described in "Practical Metaprogramming",
	J.R. Cordy & M. Shukla, Proc. CASCON'92, IBM Centre for Advanced
	Studies 1992 Conference, Toronto, October 1992.

	CGdb.Txl transforms a structured Prolog factbase describing the
	interface to a library of C functions into the C 'glue' routines 
	necessary to provide access to the C library from M-Prolog programs.

	EPdb.Txl transforms the same factbase into a C entry-point array
	mapping the M-Prolog string names of the functions in the library
	to pointers to the glue routines.

	FHdb.Txl transforms the same factbase into a set of C external
	function declarations for the C library routines.

	The GL.facts factbase given as an example is an abridged 
	specification of the Silicon Graphics standard GL graphics library.
