New Postcondition Bugs
TXL 7.4
5.10.93

Yes, friends, these are yet another instance of that good ol'
post condition bug.  The problem is, we decide not to copy 
a variable bound in the main pattern and then used in a construct, 
apply a rule to it, and then because of a fail in a subsequent 'where' 
or 'deconstruct', we return without making a replacement, leaving the 
main pattern match trashed.
