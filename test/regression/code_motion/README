TXL Example Specification
-------------------------

Name:	
	liftexpn.Txl
	liftassign.Txl

Description:
	Two code motion optimizations for Turing Plus programs
	demonstrating how to get the effect of dataflow analysis
	in TXL.  Liftexpn.Txl moves the computation of all 
	loop-independent nontrivial expressions outside of loops 
	and for loops.  Liftassign.Txl moves all loop-independent 
	assignment statements outside of loops.

Examples:
	txl test1.liftexpn
	txl test1.liftassign

    (Cascaded optimization - first lift expressions, then assignments)
	txl test2.liftexpn > test2.liftassign
	    - then -
	txl test2.liftassign
