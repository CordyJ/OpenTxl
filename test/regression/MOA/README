So far includes:

A new fully shaped notation for array constants, but also 
accepts scalars and vectors in traditional simplified form.

Normalizes all input to fully shaped array constant form,
reduces, then denormalizes all output to simplified form.

The reductions implemented so far are: 

	- simplification and folding of *all*
	    arithmetic operations and cats of any dimensionality, 

	- simplification and folding of all 
	    *scalar* takes and drops of any dimensionality
