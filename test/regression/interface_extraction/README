TXL Example Specification
-------------------------

Name:	
	OOTstub.Txl

Description:
	TXL program to construct the 'stub' (interface) of an Object-Oriented
	Turing (OOT) module or monitor given the source of an implementation.  
	The interface consists of the exported items, their signatures
	and types.  The transform is careful to retain comments from the 
	implementation source that are relevant to the interface specification.  
	In order to do this, it assumes that a project-standard commenting 
	convention has been used in the implementation (although the transform
	will work, ignoring comments, even if this commenting convention is 
	not followed).

	This transform is intended to be used as an embedded process in a
	software engineering environment.
