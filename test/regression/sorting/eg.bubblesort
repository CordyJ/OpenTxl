this is a small set of words for the sorter to sort
it could take a long time depending on which sort we use
then again it may be that i am underestimating the speed
with which this might go but i doubt it
if the list of words gets long enough then we will begin
to notice a difference between the two algorithms
however on these modern fast machines it is difficult to
demonstrate that without a truly long list of words to sort
