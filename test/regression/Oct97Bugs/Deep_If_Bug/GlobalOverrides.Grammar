%% Correction for sort Statement..

% Given a version number on January 2, 1997
%
%       v1.0    Added a fix to DEPENDING_ON_id so that it used identifier instead of id
%               because RBC code contained fully-qualified names in the depending on 
%               clause.
%  1.1  Feb 20, 1997     TD.
%       - Added SQL overrides.  Shotgun approach.  Any token (including all keywords) is allowed between
%         EXEC SQL .. END-EXEC except for EXEC and END-EXEC.  This will be refined in some future version
%         of the grammar
%  1.2  Feb 20, 1997     TD.
%       - Changed SQL overrides to be overrides for any EXEC.  Changed name of statement to refer to it.
%         however, the exec_sql_clause stays the same because it is mentioned in too many overrides
%         to fix with a simple override.  Will be fixed in version 7.0.x (x >= 1) of the grammar
%
%  1.3  March 5, 1997 T.D.
%         - Added keywords to keyword list
%               BASIS, INCLUDE, READY ,TRACE, PROCESS
%        - don't need dots after END-EXEC in data division.
%  1.4  March 19, 1996, T.D.
%       - All changes merged into main grammar
