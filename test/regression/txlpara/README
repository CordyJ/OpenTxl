TXL Example Specification
-------------------------

Name:	
	Txlpara.Txl

Description:
	A TXL program to pretty-print TXL programs.
	Uses some tricky (and obtuse) grammatical formatting 
	techniques to paragraph TXL programs into a pleasing 
	standard form.  
	
	NOTE: Since TXL syntax is so inherently ambiguous and 
	dependent on the target language, the output from 
	txlpara often needs a small amount of hand tuning.
