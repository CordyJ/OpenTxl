TXL Example Specification
-------------------------

Name:	
	FB.Txl

Description:
	A transformation to a dialect of the Occam parallel
	processing language.  The aim of the transformation is
	to detect conditional expressions of IF statements and 
	replace them with a variable "BranchTest[i]",  where i is
	incremented for each conditional expression found in a procedure.
	The BranchTest variable is added to the formal parameters of
	the procedure and the procedure name is changed to a special
	default name.  This will allow the procedure to be called by
	a special timing harness program that calls the procedure and 
	manipulates the conditional branches to tune performance.
