Hi Jim,

    I am aware of the problems of supporting starting users.  But this
apparent BUG should be easy to answer and any comments will be appreciated.
Thanks in advance. Furthermore, copy of your YACC -> Txl translator would be
appreciated.

You said that TXL "thrives" on ambiguous grammars and the BNF -> TXL
application I'm trying does contain one.  Since in BNF there is no
END-OF-RULE delimiter (save the visual clue of a blank line) the HEAD of a
rule could be taken as part of the body of the preceding one.  Below, is
"test_suite" part of the "bbb" rule or the start of the next rule?

bbb ::=
   toto
|  jack
|  marie

test_suite  ::= systemdef

Here is the text being processed; then the error message by the MAC 7.7
version.... I haven't tried UNIX on this,  and finally the TXL program:
============================

bbb ::=
   toto
|  jack
|  marie

test_suite  ::= systemdef

aaa ::=  fred and harry
