TXL Example Specification
-------------------------

Name:   
        par.Txl

Description:
        This TXL program takes an arbitrary standard Pascal program
        as input and collects all sequences of independent assignments 
        into single parallel assignment statements.  The parallelization
        is semantics-preserving, which means it will not parallelize
        any assignments that are mututally dependent.
