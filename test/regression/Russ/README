This demonstrates a remaining problem with left recursive
grammars.  The nonterminal [exp] seems to cause trouble;
thiungs that are legal do not parse.

The problem seems to come up with the [rhs] nonterminal.
If the [cases] alternative is first, all works wonderfully.
Something about the right recursion.
