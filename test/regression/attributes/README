TXL Example Specification
-------------------------

Name:	
	attr.Txl
	valattr.Txl

Description:
	Two trivial demonstrations of the use of TXL 8's attribution 
	facility.  Optional attributes of arbitrary complexity can be 
	attached at any point in the grammar using the [attr X] form, 
	where [X] is any terminal or nonterminal.  Attributes can
	be arbitrarily used in the TXL program, but do not appear in
	the final output unless the -attr flag is explicitly given.

	'attr.Txl' is an example of using attributes to mark items.

	'valattr.Txl' is an example of using attributes to associate
	computed values with items to assist in later transformation steps.
