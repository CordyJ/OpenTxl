TXL Example Specification
-------------------------

Name:	
	Cascade.Txl
	Compound.Txl

Description:
	Two prototype extensions to the concurrent language 
	Abacus, to allow cascaded and compounded concurrent 
	behaviour expressions.

	Abacus is an executable notation for describing concurrent 
	behaviours, based loosely on ideas from CSP and CCS.  
	The notation is suggestive of CSP.  The cascade dialect 
	extends Abacus to allow sequences consisting of several 
	guards, and the compound dialect extends to allow both
	cascaded and compound parenthesized behaviours.  

	The TXL specifications for each dialect transform the
	new forms to equivalent basic Abacus by introducing new
	intermediate named behaviours.
