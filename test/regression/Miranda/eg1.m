||defines ackerman's function, beloved of recursion theorists.  Example
||      ack 3 3
||should yield 61, after doing a huge amount of recursion.  Can only be
||called for small arguments, because the values get so big.
;
ack 0 n = n+1
;
ack (m+1) 0 = ack m 1
;
ack (m+1) (n+1) = ack m (ack (m+1) n)
;
ack 2 3
