TXL Example Specification
-------------------------

Name:	
	Calculator.Txl
	DP.Txl
	Sort.Txl
	Mates.Txl
	Denormalize-Mates.Txl
	Normalize-Mates.Txl

Description:
	Various general purpose transformational tasks implemented in TXL
	to test the range of applicability of the tool.

	Calculator - A simple numeric expression calculator,
		transforms a numeric expression into its result value.

	DP    - Computer the dot product of two vectors.
	
	Sort  - Bubble sort of a sequence of numbers.

	Mates, Denormalize-Mates, Normalize-Mates - 
		Implementation of a normalizer and simplifier for
		logical propositions expressed in the Mates system of
		logic notation.  
		
	The Mates simplifier does a fair job of proposition simplification
	using a small set of standard axioms and theorems to transform
	subterms.  Does some useful but not difficult theorem proving.
