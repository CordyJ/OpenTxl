TXL Example Specification
-------------------------

Name:	
	onceover.Txl
	addone.Txl

Description:
	Trivial demonstration of two possible paradigms for applying a rule 
	or function exactly once to each element of a given type in an 
	arbitrary scope, even if the result of the rule or function matches 
	the pattern.

	The first paradigm uses the strategy of enumerating all the instances
	to be changed and then using 'each' to find and change each one.
	'onceover.Txl' uses this paradigm to change the name of every 
	identifier in a scope to 'name_ident', where 'name' is the original 
	identifier.

	The second (more general) paradigm uses an invisible attribute
	to mark each instance as it is changed.  'addone.Txl' uses this paradigm
	to add one to every [number] in a scope exactly once.
