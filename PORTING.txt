Porting OpenTxl to a platform that does not support Turing+

To port OpenTxl to a platform not supported by Turing+, use the command "make C" 
in this directory on a supported platform to make the auto-generated C directory "csrc", 
copy the "csrc" directory to the new platform, then build on the new platform as described 
in the README.txt file in the "csrc" directory.
