 Getting Started with OpenTxl
==============================

Step 1. Install OpenTxl

    To install TXL on your system, run the ./InstallTxl.sh command
    script in this directory.

    If you run the script as the superuser (root), the script will
    install TXL globally for all users of the system in the directory
    /usr/local/bin.  If you run the script as your own userid, it will 
    install TXL for your private use in your command directory ~/bin .

    In either case, you must make sure that the directory containing
    the TXL commands (either /usr/local/bin or ~/bin) is in your 
    command search path.

Step 2. Learn TXL

    You'll find documentation of the TXL language, the TXL commands,
    TXL error messages and lots more on the TXL Documentation page,

        http://www.txl.ca/txl-docs.html

    If you are a new user, you should begin your exploration of
    TXL by visiting the TXL learning resources page,

        http://www.txl.ca/txl-learn.html

    Begin with the guided tour of TXL, and move on to the TXL
    Challenge, a structured sequence of programming problems designed
    to introduce you to the style and paradigm of TXL.

Step 3. Visit TXL World

    Once you have learned the basics, move on to looking at the
    many examples of what others have done with TXL and how they
    have done it, on the TXL World page,

        http://www.txl.ca/txl-resources.html

    There you will also find grammars and rulesets that will help
    you to get started in whatever line of source transformation
    you have in mind.

Step 4. Away You Go!

    When you're ready to tackle your own problems in TXL, keep
    in mind that you can find answers to frequently asked questions,
    ask your own questions, and report problems and bugs on the
    TXL Support page,
